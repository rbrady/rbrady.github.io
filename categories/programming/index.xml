&lt;p>Gleam is a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). It has a strong type system, which helps catch mistakes before your program runs. Itâ€™s also designed to work well with Erlang and Elixir, making it great for building reliable and scalable applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-created-gleam">Who Created Gleam?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Gleam was created by Louis Pilfold. He wanted a language that combined the reliability of the Erlang ecosystem with a more structured and easy-to-use type system. Gleam takes inspiration from languages like OCaml and Elm, focusing on simplicity and performance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
